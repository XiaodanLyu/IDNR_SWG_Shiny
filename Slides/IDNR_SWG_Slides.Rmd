## Introduction

- Data Collection  
    + Multiple Species Inventory and Monitoring (MSIM) Program  
    + Iowa DNR and Iowa State University
- Survey Objects  
    + 414 SGCN, only 69 SGCN where sufficient data were available
    + Birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, odonates and butterflies
- Primary Sampling Interval  
    + 2006-2014

## Objectives

- Predict the distribution of species of conservation need  
    + robust design occupancy model
- Create predictive species maps for priority SGCN  
    + ArcGIS raster files
    + Shiny interactive web application
- Prioritize areas of conservation action for SGCN  
    + habitat restoration and management

## Methods

- Robust design occupancy model (MacKenzie et al. 2003)  
    + package RMark
- Parameters of Interest  
    + probability of occupancy ($\psi$)
    + probability of colonization ($\gamma$)
    + probability of extinction ($\epsilon$)
    + probability of detection ($p$)
- Model types
    + RDOccupEG, RDOccupPE, RDOccupPG, ...

## Methods

- Including Covariates
$$ \theta = \frac{exp(\boldsymbol{Z'\beta})}{1+exp(\boldsymbol{Z'\beta})} $$
    + $\theta$ is the probability of interest
    + $\mathbf{Z}$ is the matrix of covariate information
    + $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is the vector of logistic model coefficients to be estimated

- Landscape habitat variables
    + Radius of sampled site: 200m, 500m and 1km
    + Land use classification:   
      Water, Wetland, Grassland, Woodland and Agriculture
    + Landscape configuration:  
      percentage of landscape (PLAND), large patch index (LPI),
      edge density (ED), patch density (PD) and interspersion-juxtaposition (IJI)
- Climate variables
    + Wind, Cloud, Temperature

## Model Selection and Validation

- Akaike's Information Criterion adjusted for small sizes ($\text{AIC}_c$)  
    + Models with $\Delta \text{AIC}_c \leq 2 \Rightarrow$  strong support  
      (Burnham and Anderson 2002)
- Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)  
    + evaluate performance of predicting occupancy
    + training data set: survey years 2006-2012, 2004
    + test data set: survey year 2013 (better representative)
    + package pROC
    + $\text{AUC} = 0.5 \Rightarrow$ random guess
    + $\text{AUC} = 1.0 \Rightarrow$ perfect prediction  
      (Jimenez-Valverde 2012)
  
## Results

| Statistics | Value/Range | 
| ------------ | -------- |
| Number of SGCN modeled | 64 out of 69 |
| Occupancy Prob $\hat\psi$ | 0.001(0.0003)~0.995(0.004) |
| Colonization Prob $\hat\gamma$ | 0.0003(0.0001)~0.999(0.00007) |
| Detection Prob $\hat p$ | 0.030(0.028)~0.998(0.006) |
| AUC values | 0.426~0.921 |
| Number of $\text{AUC} > 0.5$ | 61 out of 64 |

## Shiny

- **Shiny** by RStudio is a web application framework for R.  
- No HTML, CSS or JavaScript knowledge required to turn your analyses into interactive web applications.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=T}
install.packages("shiny")
library("shiny")
runExample("01_hello")
```

- ui.R defines the page layout and user interface
- server.R contains the R code to create any output
- More information available at [\colorbox{yellow}{Shiny Webpage}](http://shiny.rstudio.com/)

## About Our Shiny Application

- Interactive web application to display predictive maps and parameter estimates for each SGCN
- Easy to download personalized data and maps
- Available to researchers and managers across Iowa (credentials needed)
- Hosted by CSSM for 1-2 years
- The URL for accessing the application is [\colorbox{yellow}{https://dnrswg.cssm.iastate.edu/}](https://dnrswg.cssm.iastate.edu/)
